## Custom Playlist

You can use your own M3U playlist or your IPTV provider's URL. The app supports:

- M3U format with EXTINF tags
- Group categorization (group-title attribute)
- Channel logos (tvg-logo attribute)

### Test Playlist

The included `test.m3u` file has only 5 channels for quick testing.
The default `CO.m3u` contains Colombian TV channels and loads quickly.

For other countries, you can find playlists at:

- https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv (Warning: Very large, may cause loading issues)
- https://m3u.cl/ (Regional playlists by country)

## Troubleshooting

### App crashes on startup

1. Check your internet connection
2. Try using a smaller playlist first (like `test.m3u`)
3. Connect to telnet port 8085 on your Roku to see debug logs:
   ```
   telnet YOUR_ROKU_IP 8085
   ```
4. Look for error messages in the console

### Playlist not loading

- Verify the URL is accessible from a browser
- Make sure the playlist is in M3U format
- Check if the server supports HTTPS with valid certificates
- Try the "Set back to Demo" button to use the default playlist
